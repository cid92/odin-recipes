    <h1>Description</h1>
     <p>Penang Laksa is a noodle soup dish that typically includes rice vermicelli noodles, fish-based broth, and a medley of flavorful ingredients. The broth is tangy and spicy, made with a rich base of fish stock, tamarind, lemongrass, galangal, and chili paste. The soup is traditionally garnished with various toppings like flaked mackerel, cucumber, onions, mint leaves, and a generous squeeze of lime juice.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>For the broth:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams mackerel or other white fish fillets</li>
        <li>1 liter water</li>
        <li>2 stalks lemongrass, bruised</li>
        <li>3-4 slices galangal or ginger</li>
        <li>4-5 kaffir lime leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tamarind paste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chili paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shrimp paste (belacan)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the laksa:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams rice vermicelli noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts (optional)</li>
        <li>Hard-boiled eggs, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the fish stock. In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the fish fillets and cook until they are just cooked through. Remove the fish from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add lemongrass, galangal or ginger, kaffir lime leaves, tamarind paste, chili paste, and shrimp paste to the pot. Allow the broth to simmer for about 20-30 minutes to extract the flavors from the aromatics.</li>
        <li>Once the broth is well-infused, strain it to remove the solid ingredients and return the broth to the pot. Use a fork to flake the cooked fish fillets and add them back to the pot. Simmer the broth for an additional 5 minutes to allow the fish flavors to meld with the broth. Season with salt to taste.    </li>
        <li>Prepare the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>To serve, place a portion of rice vermicelli noodles in each bowl. Ladle the hot fish broth over the noodles, making sure to include some fish flakes in each bowl.</li>
        <li>Garnish the laksa with julienned cucumber, sliced red onion, fresh mint leaves, fresh coriander leaves, bean sprouts (if desired), and sliced hard-boiled eggs (optional).</li>
        <li>Serve the Penang Laksa hot with lime wedges on the side. Squeeze lime juice over the laksa just before eating to enhance the flavors.</li>  
    </ol>
    <p>Penang Laksa is best enjoyed immediately while hot. It offers a delightful blend of tangy, spicy, and refreshing flavors that make it a beloved dish in Malaysian cuisine.</p>
