    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna pasta sheets (pre-cooked)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Italian herbs and spices (such as basil, oregano, thyme, and parsley)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (optional, such as spinach, zucchini, or eggplant)</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes or tomato puree</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>    
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
   <p>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (usually around 350°F to 375°F or 175°C to 190°C).</li>
        <li> In a large skillet or saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li> If you're using ground meat, add it to the skillet and cook until it is browned and cooked through. Break up any clumps with a spoon or spatula as it cooks.</li>
        <li> Once the meat is cooked, add the crushed tomatoes or tomato puree to the skillet, along with the Italian herbs and spices (such as basil, oregano, thyme, and parsley). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li> Allow the sauce to simmer over low heat for about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
        <li> If you're adding vegetables, prepare them accordingly. For example, you can sauté spinach until wilted or slice and lightly cook zucchini or eggplant to remove excess moisture.</li>
        <li> In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese or cottage cheese with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Mix well to incorporate the seasoning.</li>
        <li> Now it's time to assemble the lasagna layers. Start by spreading a thin layer of the tomato sauce at the bottom of a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li> Place a layer of pre-cooked lasagna pasta sheets on top of the sauce, covering the bottom of the dish. You may need to break the sheets to fit them properly.</li>
        <li> Spread a layer of the tomato sauce over the pasta sheets, followed by dollops of the ricotta or cottage cheese mixture. You can also add a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li> If you're adding vegetables, layer them over the cheese mixture.</li>
        <li> Repeat the layers until you run out of ingredients or reach the desired height of your lasagna, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil.</li>
        <li> Place the lasagna in the preheated oven and bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li> Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown and form a crispy top layer.</li>
        <li> Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li> Cut into portions and serve hot, garnishing with fresh herbs like basil or parsley, if desired.</li>
   </ol>
