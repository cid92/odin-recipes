    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Lamb Madras is a curry dish characterized by its robust and spicy flavor profile. It typically features tender pieces of lamb cooked in a thick, fragrant sauce made with a combination of spices, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger. The dish is often finished with a touch of coconut milk or yogurt to balance the heat and add creaminess. It is traditionally served with steamed rice or naan bread.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams lamb, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Madras curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk or plain yogurt</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the skillet and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb pieces to the skillet and cook until they are browned on all sides. This will help seal in the juices and add flavor to the curry.</li>
        <li>Once the lamb is browned, add the chopped tomatoes to the skillet and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the Madras curry powder, ground turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, and chili powder. Add this spice mixture to the skillet and stir well to coat the lamb and onions.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough water to cover the lamb, reduce the heat to low, and cover the skillet. Allow the lamb to simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours or until it becomes tender and the flavors have melded together. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to maintain a thick but saucy consistency.</li>
        <li>Once the lamb is cooked, stir in the coconut milk or plain yogurt. Adjust the salt according to your taste preference. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to heat the sauce through.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary, adding more chili powder for additional heat if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the Lamb Madras hot, garnished with fresh coriander leaves. It pairs well with steamed rice, naan bread, or roti.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Lamb Madras is a flavorful and satisfying curry dish that showcases the richness of Indian spices and the tenderness of the lamb. Enjoy this delicious and aromatic dish with your favorite accompaniments.</p>
